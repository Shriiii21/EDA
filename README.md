Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering Projects 
Overview
This repository contains my work on three exciting datasets where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering to uncover insights and prepare the data for further analysis and modeling.

Datasets Analyzed
Red Wine Quality Dataset 

Analyzed factors influencing wine quality, such as alcohol content, acidity, and residual sugar.
Explored relationships between attributes to identify key factors affecting quality ratings.
Google Play Store Dataset 

Investigated app trends, ratings, installations, and app categories.
Cleaned and preprocessed messy data, including handling missing values and inconsistent formats.
Flight Price Dataset 

Examined factors such as airline, departure time, duration, and destination affecting flight prices.
Encoded categorical variables and handled missing data to make the dataset suitable for analysis.
Key Focus Areas
Data Cleaning:

Addressed missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies to ensure high-quality datasets.
Feature Engineering:

Created meaningful new features to enhance data interpretability and model performance.
Visualization:

Used Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations for trends, distributions, and correlations.
